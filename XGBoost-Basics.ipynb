AdaBoost works by weighting the observations, putting more weight on difficult to classify instances and less on those already handled well. New weak learners are added sequentially that focus their training on the more difficult patterns.\n",

For example, regression may use a squared error and classification may use logarithmic loss. A benefit of the gradient boosting framework is that a new boosting algorithm does not have to be derived for each loss function that may want to be used, instead, it is a generic enough framework that any differentiable loss function can be used."

    "#### Decision trees are used as the weak learner in gradient boosting. Specifically regression trees are used that output real values for splits and whose output can be added together, allowing subsequent models outputs to be added and correct the residuals in the predictions. Trees are constructed in a greedy manner, choosing the best split points based on purity scores like Gini or to minimize the loss. Initially, such as in the case of AdaBoost, very short decision trees were used that only had a single split, called a decision stump. Larger trees can be used generally with 4-to-8 levels. It is common to constrain the weak learners in specific ways, such as a maximum number of layers, nodes, splits or leaf nodes. This is to ensure that the learners remain weak, but can still be constructed in a greedy manner."

Traditionally, gradient descent is used to minimize a set of parameters, such as the coefficients in a regression equation or weights in a neural network. After calculating error or loss, the weights are updated to minimize that error."
